# Userscripts

These scripts are designed for Tampermonkey, although they almost certainly work with other userscript managers.

**CGCC:**

- **[Feed Filter](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/feed-filter.user.js):** Adds various features and bug fixes to The Nineteenth Byte, including:
  - The ability to filter downvoted or closed questions from the feeds
  - The ability to minimize or hide oneboxes
  - An optional feature which display sandbox posts' titles in the New Sandboxed Posts feed, rather than just `Sandbox for Proposed Challenges`
  - This also works with the New Bounties With No Deadlines and New Loophole Proposal feeds
- **[Random Question](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/random-question.user.js):** Adds a button to the questions page that takes you to a random question (also available in the [sidebar](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/random-question-sidebar.user.js))
- **[Quick Comments](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/quick-comments.user.js):** Adds ten customizable messages that can be quickly inserted into comments, making reviewing easier
- **[Question Reception](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/question-reception.user.js):** Adds a customizable `Reception` item under questions' titles, which shows their upvote percentage and controversialness rating by default. Also supports custom configurations ([examples](https://gist.github.com/RedwolfPrograms/72407590f4342964d09bd3002f374311))
- **[Chat Monospace Fix](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/chat-monospace-fix.user.js):** Updates `<code>` in chat to have the same formatting as main
- **[New Posts](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/new-posts.user.js):** Adds a `https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/posts/new` page, which lists new questions and answers as they're posted

**Other:**

- **[XKCD Arrows](https://github.com/RedwolfPrograms/userscripts/raw/main/xkcd-arrows.user.js):** Adds a few features to xkcd.com, including:
  - Automatic scrolling (if necessary) to position the actual content where it's immediately visible
  - Title text is placed under the image, so hovering is unnecessary
  - Arrow keys can be used to navigate to the next and previous XKCD
